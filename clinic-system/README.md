This project represents a Clinic Management System designed to manage basic clinical operations using object-oriented programming principles and an SQLite3 database. 
The system stores and maintains information about patients, doctors, and appointments in a structured and reliable way. 
Each patient record includes personal and medical details such as name, age, contact information, and a unique patient ID. 
Doctors are recorded with their specialization, allowing the clinic to organize staff by medical expertise. 
The system ensures data consistency by using primary keys and defined relationships between entities.

The main functionality of the system focuses on supporting clinic administration tasks. 
It allows users to retrieve a complete list of senior patients (patients older than 65 years) and to calculate the total number of doctors who specialize in ophthalmology. 
These features demonstrate effective use of SQL queries, entity relationships, and object-oriented design. 
The project also includes ER and Use Case diagrams to visually represent system structure and interactions.
