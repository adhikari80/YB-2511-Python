This program demonstrates object-oriented inheritance using a college system.
A base class Person contains common attributes.
Student and Staff inherit from Person.
General and Academic further inherit from Staff, showing multilevel inheritance.

All classes are implemented in one Python file for simplicity, while still maintaining clean structure and clear inheritance relationships.
